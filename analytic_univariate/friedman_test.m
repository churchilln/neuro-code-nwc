function [ prob, sigdiff ] = friedman_test( respBlock, varargin )
% performs the Friedman test statistic on multiple-treatment blocks:
% 
%         [prob sigdiff] =  friedman_test( respBlock, (alpha) ) 
%
% wherein [ respBlock = 'treatments' x 'observations' ]
% e.g. each column is a block of observed treatments.
% 
% * Note that observations should be independant
% * Note also: test statistic given by Chi-Square approximation;
%   ideal performance is given for large samples and/or many treatments
% * sigdiff = critical difference at given alpha, for test
% * if alpha not specified, default is 0.05

% get friedman statistic:
% sum-of-squares difference between all treatment means and grand mean,
% with factor giving normal approximation for large samples:
Q = 12*N/( s*(s+1) ) * sum( (meanRank - grandMean).^2 );

% probability of difference >= Q approximated by the Chi-Square 
% cumulative distribution (for df = s-1):

% computing critical difference:
% (1) set critical inv-tscore
thresh = tinv(1-alpha/2, (N-1)*(s-1));
% (2) compute C-value, based on design
C = N*s*(s+1)*(s-1)/12;
% (3) now compute critical difference in ranks for sig. difference
sigdiff = (thresh/N) * sqrt( ( 2*N*C/( (N-1)*(s-1)) ) * (1 - Q/(N*(s-1))) );
